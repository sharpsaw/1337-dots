# http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Grabs
# Keys
# Look at:  /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h (Strip the "XK_" part)
#  Numbers and letters keep their names, so a is a and 0 is 0
#  Keypad keys need KP_ as prefix, so KP_1 is 1 on the keypad
#  Keys usually have meaningful english names
#  Modifier keys have special meaning (Alt (A), Control (C), Meta (M),
#   Shift (S), Super (W))
#  Mouse:
#   B1 = Left mouse button
#   B2 = Middle mouse button
#   B3 = Right mouse button
#   B4 = Mouse wheel up
#   B5 = Mouse wheel down
#
# Can be chained:
#  Example: grab "C-y Return", "urxvt"
#
# Second arg can be:
#  symbol: Run a subtle action
#  string: Run a program (like system())
#  lambda: Run a Ruby proc
#  array:  Cycle through gravities

# Super + Retern = run a terminal

# This is similar to the default OS X bindings (which have to be enabled, but

# It's a nice binding because:
#  a) Everybody should remap Caps to Ctrl, IMO
#  b) Terminal apps can't do much with those bindings anyhow.

# == Screen
#
# Generally subtle comes with two panels per screen, one on the top and one at
# the bottom. Each panel can be configured with different panel items and
# sublets screen wise. The default config uses top panel on the first screen
# only, it's up to the user to enable the bottom panel or disable either one
# or both.

# === Properties
#
# [*stipple*]    This property adds a stipple pattern to both screen panels.
#
#                Example: stipple "~/stipple.xbm"
#                         stipple Subtlext::Icon.new("~/stipple.xbm")
#

# http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Panel
screen 1 do
  top    [ :views, :title, :spacer, :keychain, :spacer, :tray, :sublets ]
  bottom [ ]
end

# Example for a second screen:
#screen 2 do
#  top    [ :views, :title, :spacer ]
#  bottom [ ]
#end

#
# == Styles
#
# Styles define various properties of styleable items in a CSS-like syntax.
#
# If no background color is given no color will be set. This will ensure a
# custom background pixmap won't be overwritten.
#
# Following properties are available for most the styles:
#
# [*foreground*] Foreground text color
# [*background*] Background color
# [*margin*]     Outer spacing
# [*border*]     Border color and size
# [*padding*]    Inner spacing
# [*font*]       Font string (xftontsel or xft)
#

  background  "#3d3d3d"
  stipple     "#757575"
end

#
# == Gravities
#
# Gravities are predefined sizes a window can be set to. There are several ways
# to set a certain gravity, most convenient is to define a gravity via a tag or
# change them during runtime via grab. Subtler and subtlext can also modify
# gravities.
#
# A gravity consists of four values which are a percentage value of the screen
# size. The first two values are x and y starting at the center of the screen
# and he last two values are the width and height.
#
# === Example
#
# Following defines a gravity for a window with 100% width and height:
#
#   gravity :example, [ 0, 0, 100, 100 ]
#

#
# == Sublets
#
# Sublets are Ruby scripts that provide data for the panel and can be managed
# with the sur script that comes with subtle.
#
# === Example
#
#  sur install clock
#  sur uninstall clock
#  sur list
#
# === Configuration
#
# All sublets have a set of configuration values that can be changed directly
# from the config of subtle.
#
# There are three default properties, that can be be changed for every sublet:
#
# [*interval*]    Update interval of the sublet
# [*foreground*]  Default foreground color
# [*background*]  Default background color
#
# sur can also give a brief overview about properties:
#
# === Example
#
#   sur config clock
#
# The syntax of the sublet configuration is similar to other configuration
# options in subtle:
#
# === Example
#
#  sublet :clock do
#    interval      30
#    foreground    "#eeeeee"
#    background    "#000000"
#    format_string "%H:%M:%S"
#  end
#
#  === Link
#
# http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Sublets
#

#
# == Hooks
#
# And finally hooks are a way to bind Ruby scripts to a certain event.
#
# Following hooks exist so far:
#
# [*:client_create*]    Called whenever a window is created
# [*:client_configure*] Called whenever a window is configured
# [*:client_focus*]     Called whenever a window gets focus
# [*:client_kill*]      Called whenever a window is killed
#
# [*:tag_create*]       Called whenever a tag is created
# [*:tag_kill*]         Called whenever a tag is killed
#
# [*:view_create*]      Called whenever a view is created
# [*:view_configure*]   Called whenever a view is configured
# [*:view_jump*]        Called whenever the view is switched
# [*:view_kill*]        Called whenever a view is killed
#
# [*:tile*]             Called on whenever tiling would be needed
# [*:reload*]           Called on reload
# [*:start*]            Called on start
# [*:exit*]             Called on exit
#
# === Example
#
# This hook will print the name of the window that gets the focus:
#
#   on :client_focus do |c|
#     puts c.name
#   end
